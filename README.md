Example of a Python text-based adventure game created by ChatGBT

From ChatGBT:
>>This code defines a dictionary called "rooms" that contains the different rooms in the game, and their descriptions and exits. The player starts in the >>"outside" room, and the game loop allows them to move between rooms by entering a direction (north, south, east, or west in this example) when          >>prompted. If the player enters an invalid direction, the game will print "You can't go that way."
>>This is a simple example, you could add different levels, puzzles and items that the player can pick up and interact with to make it more interesting.
